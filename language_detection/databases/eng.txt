Ignorance is bliss.

Isn't it beautiful?
Isn't it delicious?
Isn't she a doctor?
Isn't that amazing?
Isn't that curious?
Isn't that illegal?
Isn't that obvious?
It belonged to Tom.
It changed my life.
It could be a hoax.
It could be anyone.
It could get worse.
It falls on Sunday.
It feels like home.
It feels like rain.
It gave me an idea.
It has to be there.
It helped me a lot.
It is Monday today.
It is a black hole.
It is a long story.
It is already dark.
It is bad to steal.
It is cloudy today.
It is dark outside.
It is easy to swim.
It is his decision.
It isn't expensive.
It isn't important.
It isn't just here.
It keeps happening.
It looks delicious.
It looks fantastic.
It looks like rain.
It looks like snow.
It made me shudder.
It might be a trap.
It must be a virus.
It must be removed.
It rained that day.
It started to snow.
It was Tom's fault.
It was a bad movie.
It was a challenge.
It was a fair game.
It was a fun night.
It was a good idea.
It was a huge deal.
It was a nightmare.
It was all so easy.
It was an accident.
It was complicated.
It was fascinating.
It was frightening.
It was hot and dry.
It was hot outside.
It was interesting.
It was just a joke.
It was just a kiss.
It was my suitcase.
It was on the list.
It was only a joke.
It was pitch-black.
It was pretty cool.
It was pretty dark.
It was pretty easy.
It was pretty good.
It was pretty huge.
It was quite funny.
It was quite windy.
It was really cold.
It was really cool.
It was really easy.
It was really good.
It was sensational.
It was so romantic.
It was still there.
It was their fault.
It was unavoidable.
It was very simple.
It was worse today.
It was your choice.
It wasn't a threat.
It wasn't my fault.
It wasn't personal.
It wasn't possible.
It wasn't too soon.
It wasn't upstairs.
It wasn't very fun.
It won't be enough.
It won't last long.
It works perfectly.
It'll be a big day.
It'll be all right.
It'll be difficult.
It'll be hilarious.
It'll happen again.
It'll rain tonight.
It's Tom's profile.
It's Tom, isn't it?
It's a Cuban cigar.
It's a French book.
It's a French word.
It's a bad example.
It's a big country.
It's a bit awkward.
It's a catchy song.
It's a coincidence.
It's a comedy show.
It's a common name.
It's a common vice.
It's a distraction.
It's a funny movie.
It's a good camera.
It's a great party.
It's a huge gamble.
It's a perfect day.
It's a proven fact.
It's a small world.
It's a typo. Sorry.
It's a vague story.
It's a work of art.
It's all our fault.
It's all right now.
It's all so absurd.
It's already seven.
It's an experiment.
It's an investment.
It's crowded today.
It's exactly 10:00.
It's far from here.
It's far from over.
It's for my family.
It's for my friend.
It's fun to travel.
It's getting worse.
It's going to hurt.
It's going to rain.
It's gotten better.
It's hot down here.
It's in good hands.
It's in the fridge.
It's in the garage.
It's in your hands.
It's in your truck.
It's me again, Tom.
It's merely a joke.
It's mind boggling.
It's my money, too.
It's nice and cool.
It's noisy in here.
It's not Christmas.
It's not a disease.
It's not a failure.
It's not a mistake.
It's not a problem.
It's not difficult.
It's not even true.
It's not expensive.
It's not important.
It's not just that.
It's not my choice.
It's not necessary.
It's not our fault.
It's not ready yet.
It's not safe here.
It's not so little.
It's not so simple.
It's not that cold.
It's not that easy.
It's not very easy.
It's not very good.
It's not your turn.
It's now your turn.
It's our only hope.
It's past midnight.
It's pretty simple.
It's raining again!
It's raining again.
It's raining there.
It's raining today.
It's really classy.
It's really simple.
It's simple to use.
It's snowing again.
It's snowing there.
It's snowing today.
It's so depressing.
It's still crowded.
It's still raining.
It's still snowing.
It's the other one.
It's their problem.
It's time to leave.
It's time to sleep.
It's too difficult.
It's too expensive.
It's under the bed.
It's unforgettable.
It's very cold now.
It's very detailed.
It's very hot here.
It's very late now.
It's very personal.
It's very puzzling.
It's very relaxing.
It's very unlikely.
It's way too early.
Italy is in Europe.
Italy isn't Greece.
Just get rid of it.
Just remember that.
Just say yes or no.
Just start walking.

Life passed him by.
Listen to the rain.
Look at Tom's face.
Look at it closely.
Look at me, please.
Look at my new car.
Look at that house.
Look at that smoke.
Look at the sharks.
Look at this photo.

Look at what I did.
Look in the mirror.
Look into the well.
Look under the bed.
Look up at the sky.
Look what I caught.
Look what happened.
Look who's talking.
Look, it's snowing!
Love doesn't exist.
Love is everything.
Love is not enough.
Luck doesn't exist.
Luck is against me.
Luckily, it worked.
Make love, not war.
Make me a sandwich.

May I sit with you?
May I speak to Tom?

Now it's your turn.
Now's not the time.
Now, don't be late.

Our project failed.
Out of my way, boy.

Isn't that worth it?
It can be dangerous.
It didn't cost much.
It didn't last long.
It doesn't work yet.
It finally happened.
It gave me strength.
It happened in 2013.
It hasn't been easy.
It is a good camera.
It is a little cold.
It is freezing cold.
It is going to snow.
It is snowing today.
It is too expensive.
It is white as snow.
It isn't a hospital.
It isn't hard to do.
It isn't impossible.
It isn't your fault.
It looks like a UFO.
It looks like a cow.
It looks suspicious.
It made me very sad.
It makes me curious.

It wasn't a problem.
It wasn't always so.
It wasn't expensive.
It wasn't important.
It wasn't our fault.
It wasn't so simple.
It wasn't that good.
It works every time.
It'll be a long day.

It'll be a pleasure.
It'll probably rain.
It'll rain for sure.
It'll rain tomorrow.
It'll snow tomorrow.
It'll work for sure.
It's Saturday today.
It's Tom's favorite.
It's a big hospital.
It's a comedy movie.
It's a dreary place.
It's a fact of life.
It's a funny market.
It's a huge concern.
It's a mess in here.
It's a pretty house.
It's a world record.
It's about this big.
It's all new for me.
It's already eleven.
It's an inside joke.
It's as easy as pie.
It's beautiful here.
It's been completed.
It's bigger than us.
It's clearly a hoax.
It's cold out there.
It's cool, isn't it?
It's dangerous here.
It's free of charge.
It's from the Bible.
It's getting better.
It's getting cloudy.
It's going to break.
It's good, isn't it?
It's great out here.
It's happened again.
It's happened to me.
It's hard to choose.
It's hard, isn't it?
It's hard, you know.
It's in God's hands.
It's in my backpack.
It's in the kitchen.
It's in your pocket.
It's just a placebo.
It's kind of creepy.
It's my only chance.
It's never too late.
It's nice, isn't it?
It's not cold today.
It's not even funny.
It's not my problem.
It's not what we do.
It's not worth much.
It's obviously fake.
It's over, isn't it?
It's quite possible.
It's real, isn't it?
It's still dark out.
It's still for sale.
It's summer already.
It's time to change.
It's time to decide.
It's time to get up.
It's too hot for me.
It's true, isn't it?
It's useless to beg.
It's very beautiful.
It's very cold here.
It's very dangerous.
It's very difficult.
It's very effective.
It's very hot today.
It's very important.
It's very upsetting.
It's what I do best.
It's windy out here.
It's worth the risk.
It's worthless junk.
It's wrong to steal.
It's your lucky day.
It's your night off.
It's your only hope.
It's your turn, Tom.
Japanese are Asians.
Just give it a shot.
Keep an eye on them.
Keep away from here.
Keep in the shadows.
Keep it simple, Tom.
Keep your eyes open.
Kids like ice cream.
Lay it on the table.
Leave while you can.
Let Tom and me sing.

Life has just begun.
Listen to the music.
Listen while I talk.
Look after yourself.
Look at Tom's shoes.
Look at the picture.
Look straight ahead.
Look under the seat.
Look what I got you.
Love is not a crime.
Luckily nobody died.
Lucky, weren't they?
Make sure Tom comes.
Many cars passed by.
Many dogs are alive.
Mary can dance well.
Mary is my fiancée.
Mary is not my type.
Mary is pretty cute.
Mary is very pretty.
May I ask your name?
May I eat that cake?
May I eat this cake?
May I have a napkin?
May I interrupt you?
May I open the door?
May I say something?
May I speak frankly?
May I take a shower?
May I talk with you?
May I use the phone?
May I walk with you?
Maybe I fell asleep.
Maybe Tom was right.
Maybe it's not fair.
Maybe she is coming.
Maybe there is hope.

Impressive, isn't it?
Is Mary Tom's mother?
Is Tom as tall as me?
Is Tom in Boston now?
Is Tom really asleep?
Is Tom really coming?
Is Tom still at home?
Is Tom still married?
Is Tom still working?
Is anyone else going?
Is eating pork a sin?
Is flight 23 on time?
Is he reading a book?
Is it OK if we begin?
Is it OK not to wait?
Is it OK to sit here?
Is it a cat or a dog?
Is it open on Sunday?
Is it still for sale?
Is she a taxi driver?
Is she making a doll?
Is that a compliment?
Is that all you have?
Is that how it works?
Is that pencil yours?
Is that website good?
Is that why Tom left?
Is that your bicycle?
Is that your package?
Is the cat all right?
Is the phone ringing?
Is the zoo near here?
Is this Tom's office?
Is this a new hammer?
Is this a new system?
Is this all for real?
Is this all there is?
Is this beef or pork?
Is this diamond real?
Is this good English?

Is this real leather?
Is this turtle yours?
Is this your baggage?
Is this your bicycle?
Is this your husband?
Is this your opinion?

Is your wife at home?
Isn't Mary beautiful?
Isn't life beautiful?
Isn't that Tom's dog?
Isn't that confusing?
It began to sprinkle.
It belongs to me now.
It could be anyone's.
It could happen here.
It doesn't bother me.
It doesn't seem fair.
It doesn't seem real.
It feels good to win.
It felt like forever.
It gets on my nerves.
It happens sometimes.
It has my name on it.
It has to be removed.
It is a childish act.
It is already eleven.
It is in the kitchen.
It is not cold today.
It is out of fashion.
It is time to get up.
It is very hot today.
It is wrong to steal.
It isn't Tom's fault.
It just doesn't work.
It looked like a gun.
It looks fascinating.
It looks good on you.
It looks like a duck.
It looks like an egg.
It makes me feel old.
It makes me feel sad.
It may rain tomorrow.
It means a lot to me.
It meant a lot to me.
It might be too late.
It might be worth it.
It no longer matters.
It rained for a week.
It seems interesting.
It seems right to me.
It snowed last night.
It tastes just right.
It tastes like sugar.
It took half an hour.
It took just an hour.
It used to be bigger.
It was a coincidence.
It was a competition.
It was a good answer.
It was a lucky guess.
It was a stupid idea.
It was a stupid joke.
It was a tedious job.
It was an act of God.
It was an awful week.
It was disappointing.
It was extraordinary.
It was hard at first.
It was hot yesterday.
It was my first kiss.
It was time to leave.
It was too difficult.
It was too expensive.
It was very exciting.
It wasn't a bad idea.
It wasn't my mistake.
It wasn't on purpose.
It will rain tonight.
It will soon be dark.
It won't be for long.
It won't be possible.
It'll be spring soon.
It'll cost me my job.
It'll happen tonight.
It'll soon be spring.
It's October already.
It's a beautiful day!
It's a beautiful day.
It's a beautiful rug.
It's a complex issue.
It's a full time job.
It's a good question.
It's a hard question.
It's a piece of cake.
It's a stupid system.
It's a very old book.
It's a waste of time.
It's all Greek to me.
It's almost midnight.
It's already decided.
It's already started.
It's already stopped.
It's an extreme case.
It's as easy as that.
It's as plain as day.
It's been a good day.
It's been a pleasure.
It's behind schedule.
It's better as it is.
It's completely dark.
It's easier this way.
It's easy to do that.
It's easy to explain.
It's good to be home.
It's happened before.
It's happening again.
It's hard to believe.
It's hard to imagine.
It's hard to justify.
It's in the basement.
It's mean to do that.
It's mine, not Tom's.
It's much better now.
It's nice to be back.
It's not Tom's fault.
It's not a classroom.
It's not about money.
It's not always easy.
It's not an easy job.
It's not deep enough.
It's not evening yet.
It's not just a game.
It's not my decision.
It's not raining yet.
It's not really food.
It's nothing serious.
It's obviously a lie.
It's our only chance.
It's our only option.
It's pork or nothing.
It's quite delicious.
It's quite different.
It's really annoying.

I'll do what Tom says.
I'll do what you want.
I'll find another job.
I'll get to the point.
I'll give that to Tom.
I'll go get the broom.
I'll go straight home.
I'll go wash my hands.
I'll just get my coat.
I'll keep your secret.
I'll leave it at that.
I'll let Tom tell you.
I'll make some coffee.
I'll make tea for you.
I'll make you a drink.
I'll miss you so much.
I'll never forget you.
I'll never lie to you.
I'll only be a minute.
I'll only talk to Tom.
I'll see you in there.
I'll see you tomorrow.
I'll show that to Tom.
I'll sign it tomorrow.
I'll sleep in my room.
I'll soon change that.
I'll stay if it rains.
I'll take care of you.
I'll take my umbrella.
I'll take them to Tom.
I'll watch television.
I'm Tom's grandmother.
I'm Tom's replacement.
I'm a competitive guy.
I'm a little bit busy.
I'm a married man now.
I'm afraid of heights.
I'm almost speechless.
I'm already in Boston.
I'm an optimistic guy.
I'm ashamed of myself.
I'm aware of all that.
I'm back in Australia.
I'm being blackmailed.
I'm charging my phone.
I'm coming back again.
I'm convinced of that.
I'm doing my homework.
I'm done with you two.
I'm dreading the exam.
I'm drenched in sweat.
I'm easily influenced.
I'm eating a sandwich.
I'm eating dinner now.
I'm eating everything.
I'm extremely excited.
I'm fairly optimistic.
I'm feeling confident.
I'm feeling very good.
I'm finished with you.
I'm free this evening.
I'm getting a divorce.
I'm getting depressed.
I'm getting undressed.
I'm glad it wasn't me.
I'm glad that Tom won.
I'm glad to know that.
I'm glad you got back.
I'm glad you survived.
I'm glad you're happy.
I'm going back to bed.
I'm going home to bed.
I'm going to be there.
I'm going to buy wine.
I'm going to find Tom.
I'm going to go there.
I'm going to have fun.
I'm going to hurt you.
I'm going to miss Tom.
I'm going to miss you.
I'm going to need you.
I'm going to the bank.
I'm going to the park.
I'm going to work now.
I'm good at languages.
I'm good at what I do.
I'm happy to be alive.
I'm happy you're here.
I'm happy, very happy.
I'm having dinner now.
I'm in good condition.
I'm irritated by that.
I'm just being honest.
I'm just being polite.
I'm just doing my job.
I'm kind of surprised.
I'm looking for a job.
I'm looking for my ID.
I'm lucky to be alive.
I'm missing something.
I'm not Tom. I'm John.
I'm not a disbeliever.
I'm not a good person.
I'm not a good singer.
I'm not a kid anymore.

I'm not going outside.
I'm not going to look.
I'm not going to lose.
I'm not going to stay.
I'm not going to stop.
I'm not going to wait.
I'm not hungry anyway.
I'm not legally blind.
I'm not materialistic.
I'm not narrow-minded.
I'm not old fashioned.
I'm not on Tom's team.
I'm not proud of this.
I'm not really hungry.
I'm not satisfied yet.
I'm not scared at all.
I'm not scared of Tom.
I'm not scared to die.
I'm not wearing socks.
I'm not young anymore.
I'm on your side, Tom.
I'm only doing my job.
I'm pretty bummed out.
I'm proud of our team.
I'm proud of you guys.
I'm proud of you, Tom.
I'm rarely this angry.
I'm reading this book.
I'm reading your book.
I'm real proud of Tom.
I'm sick of going out.
I'm sick of this rain.
I'm still in training.
I'm still job hunting.
I'm still not certain.
I'm still on vacation.
I'm still very active.
I'm stronger than Tom.
I'm stronger than you.
I'm studying with Tom.
I'm sure I'll be fine.
I'm sure I'll do that.
I'm sure Tom is proud.
I'm sure Tom is right.
I'm sure Tom is wrong.
I'm sure of my rights.
I'm sure you're tired.
I'm taking a vacation.
I'm taking care of it.
I'm talking about you.
I'm telling the truth.
I'm the one they want.
I'm tired of fighting.
I'm tired of standing.
I'm tired of studying.
I'm tired of swimming.
I'm tired of the game.
I'm tired of you guys.
I'm to blame, not you.
I'm too sleepy to eat.
I'm too tired to walk.
I'm trying not to cry.
I'm trying to be fair.
I'm trying to do that.
I'm trying to improve.
I'm used to it by now.
I'm used to the noise.
I'm very bad at chess.
I'm very disappointed.
I'm very hungry today.
I'm very unhappy here.
I'm watching the news.
I'm working in Boston.
I'm worried about Tom.
I'm writing about you.
I'm your new roommate.
I've already finished.
I've already fixed it.
I've already paid you.
I've already seen one.
I've already told Tom.
I've already tried it.
I've always been weak.
I've always hated Tom.
I've always hated you.
I've become a new man.
I've been a lot worse.
I've been cooperative.
I've been here before.
I've been pretty busy.
I've been to the mall.
I've begun doing that.
I've borrowed a table.
I've changed the plan.
I've come to save Tom.
I've decided to leave.
I've fixed everything.
I've found the answer.
I've given up on love.
I've given up smoking.
I've got a great idea.
I've got bills to pay.
I've got nothing left.
I've got the solution.
I've got things to do.
I've got to do my job.
I've got to get going.
I've got to get ready.
I've got to stay here.
I've had a good sleep.
I've had a great week.
I've had some chances.
I've had some success.
I've helped Tom a lot.
I've just been robbed.
I've just eaten lunch.
I've learned a lesson.
I've lost my umbrella.
I've made a discovery.
I've never beaten Tom.
I've never done drugs.
I've never gone there.
I've never hit anyone.
I've never liked that.
I've never liked this.
I've only got an hour.
I've run out of paint.
I've run out of sugar.
I've run out of water.
I've seen that before.
I've stopped counting.
I've taken a big risk.
I've thought about it.
I've tried everything.
I've worked all night.
I've worked in Boston.
If not now, then when?
If you wish, I'll ask.
Is Germany near Italy?
Is Mary your daughter?
Is Tom a teacher here?
Is Tom dating someone?
Is Tom doing that now?
Is Tom from Australia?
Is Tom getting better?
Is Tom going to be OK?
Is Tom going with you?
Is Tom in the picture?
Is Tom still swimming?
Is it Tuesday already?
Is it a boy or a girl?
Is it a direct flight?
Is it an action movie?
Is it cold in Germany?
Is it easy to install?
Is it near your house?
Is it really worth it?
Is it that irrelevant?
Is it the last lesson?
Is it too complicated?
Is it too far to walk?
Is it worth it or not?
Is it worth something?
Is it worth your time?
Is my hat on straight?
Is someone calling me?
Is that Tom's bedroom?
Is that a common name?
Is that clock working?
Is that how you do it?
Is that my toothbrush?
Is that too expensive?
Is that what Tom said?
Is that what Tom says?
Is that what you said?
Is that what you want?
Is that your own idea?
Is that your umbrella?
Is there another exit?
Is there anybody left?
Is there life on Mars?
Is there someone here?
Is this a coincidence?
Is this list reliable?
Is this what you want?
Is this your daughter?
Is this your suitcase?
Is this your textbook?
Is this your umbrella?
Is tomorrow a holiday?
Is your baby sleeping?
Is your daughter here?
Is your headache gone?
Is your job dangerous?
Is your watch correct?
Isn't that a fir tree?
Isn't that astounding?
Isn't that irritating?
It all depends on Tom.
It could never happen.
It could still happen.
It depends on my mood.
It doesn't make sense.
It feels like a dream.
It feels like a setup.
It gave me a headache.
It happened last year.
It happened naturally.
It is Sunday tomorrow.
It is a very sad tale.
It is good to see you.
It is highly improper.
It is under the chair.
It is very cold today.
It is what I would do.
It isn't finished yet.
It isn't here anymore.
It isn't so hot today.
It isn't your problem.
It made me very angry.
It made me very happy.
It made my mother cry.
It may be a long time.
It may not be a dream.
It may save your life.
It might never happen.
It might rain tonight.
It might snow tonight.
It might surprise you.
It must've been quick.
It only happened once.
It reminded me of you.
It seemed interesting.
It seems like a dream.
It seems warm outside.
It seems well written.
It smells like bleach.
It sounds interesting.
It still could happen.
It was a big surprise.
It was a good example.
It was a group effort.
It was a huge success.
It was a smart choice.
It was a tense moment.
It was a terrible day.
It was a wrong number.
It was cold yesterday.
It was expensive, too.
It was hot last night.
It was my opportunity.
It was nobody's fault.
It was not my mistake.
It was pretty obvious.
It was three days ago.
It was very beautiful.
It was very difficult.
It was worth the wait.
It wasn't Tom, was it?
It wasn't good enough.
It wasn't intentional.
It wasn't interesting.
It wasn't you, was it?
It weighed three tons.
It will probably rain.
It won't be a problem.
It won't happen again.
It won't happen to me.
It won't last forever.
It won't stop raining.
It won't take so long.
It would be great fun.
It'll be hot tomorrow.
It'll definitely rain.
It'll only get better.
It's a beautiful song.
It's a bit cold today.
It's a common mistake.
It's a fine day today.
It's a good idea, Tom.
It's a matter of time.
It's a necessary evil.
It's a quarter to two.
It's a slippery slope.
It's a very big apple.
It's a very good plan.
It's a very sad story.
It's a very tough job.
It's all a conspiracy.
It's all in my report.
It's all over for you.
It's all so difficult.
It's all that matters.
It's almost lunchtime.
It's already happened.
It's already midnight.
It's become very easy.
It's been a long time.
It's been challenging.
It's driving me crazy.
It's easy to remember.
It's extremely unfair.
It's from your family.
It's going to be easy.
It's going to be good.
It's going to be hard.
It's great to be back.
It's hard to remember.
It's ironic, isn't it?
It's likely a mistake.
It's midnight already.
It's more than enough.
It's my favorite food.
It's my favorite song.
It's nice to meet you.
It's not all that bad.
It's not an easy task.
It's not finished yet.
It's not so hot today.
It's not that unusual.
It's not very durable.
It's not what we want.
It's not worth a dime.
It's not your problem.
It's now ready to use.
It's pretty hot today.
It's probably a virus.
It's probably the flu.
It's quite warm today.
It's really beautiful.
It's really cool here.
It's really stressful.
It's really up to you.
It's relatively early.
It's self-explanatory.
It's simple, you know.
It's time to be going.
It's too late for you.
It's totally my fault.
It's useless to argue.
It's very comfortable.
It's very complicated.
It's very easy to use.
It's very hot in here.
It's very windy today.
It's what Tom painted.
It's what we expected.
It's what you deserve.
Its origin is unknown.
Jesus was a carpenter.
Jupiter is very large.
Just a minute, please.
Just give me a chance.
Just give me your gun.
Just give us a chance.
Just stay right there.
Just try to keep calm.
Keep Tom away from us.
Keep it together, Tom.
Keep the toilet clean.
Keep the windows open.
Keep up the good work.
Last night I threw up.
Lay down on the couch.
Leave Tom out of this.
Leave my camera alone.
Leave this to me, Tom.
Let me ask a question.
Let me dance with you.
Let me get it for you.
Let me give you a hug.
Let me go talk to Tom.
Let me see your hands.

Let's speak in French.
Let's start the party.
Let's stop doing this.
Let's take the subway.
Let's talk about food.
Let's talk about this.
Let's travel together.
Life isn't always fun.
Like father, like son.
Lock up your passport.
Look at that building.
Look at that mountain.
Look what we've found.
Look, it's my problem.
Lunch will be at noon.
Make yourself at home.
Many of us were tired.
Marriage is a lottery.
Mary doesn't like Tom.
Mary has a dirty mind.
Mary has her problems.
Mary ironed her skirt.
Mary is Tom's ex-wife.
Mary is a grandmother.
Mary is a materialist.
Mary is afraid of men.
Mary is my girlfriend.
Mary is my stepsister.
Mary is not my sister.
Mary let Tom kiss her.
May I ask who you are?
May I ask you a favor?
May I borrow this pen?
May I eat this orange?
May I escort you home?
May I have this dance?
May I open the window?
May I sit in the back?
May I speak in French?
May I turn off the TV?
May I use this pencil?
Maybe I'll buy a bike.
Maybe Tom can save us.
Maybe we can help you.
Maybe you can help us.
Maybe you should wait.
Men like lovely women.
Might I ask your name?

That book is very old.
That can be dangerous.
That car is very fast.
That could be helpful.
That didn't help much.
That dog doesn't bite.
That game was awesome.
That gives me an idea.
That happened in 2013.
That has us concerned.
That helped you a lot.
That house is haunted.
That is an old camera.

That was all we heard.
That was only a guess.
That was what I meant.

That will impress Tom.
That woman looks rich.
That would be helpful.
That would be logical.
That would be so cool.
That would be unusual.
That would take years.

That'll be impossible.
That's Tom's daughter.
That's a great outfit.

That's a nice thought.
That's all you can do.
That's another matter.
That's awesome, right?
That's enough for now.
That's good, isn't it?
That's just an excuse.
That's kind of creepy.
That's my whole point.
That's not even funny.
That's not how it was.
That's not my problem.
That's not our policy.
That's not surprising.
That's not very funny.
That's not what we do.
That's perfectly fair.

Is that a real diamond?
Is that going to be OK?
Is that really allowed?
Is that what Tom meant?
Is that what Tom wants?
Is that your boyfriend?
Is that your real name?
Is the bank open today?
Is the bank still open?
Is the park open today?
Is the tour going well?
Is the wound very deep?
Is there a bank nearby?
Is there any milk left?
Is there any more beer?
Is there anything else?
Is there water on Mars?

Is this your cellphone?
Is today your birthday?
Is your boyfriend here?
Is your hair still wet?
Is your mother at home?
Isn't Tom your brother?
Isn't that what I said?
It brings me great joy.
It doesn't always work.
It doesn't concern you.
It doesn't have a name.
It doesn't look so bad.
It doesn't matter much.
It doesn't matter, Tom.
It doesn't seem to fit.
It doesn't surprise me.
It gives me the creeps.
It had to be a mistake.
It happened right here.
It happened so quickly.
It has happened before.
It has snowed a little.
It has stopped raining.
It has stopped working.
It has to be destroyed.
It is a moral question.
It is already too late.
It is not funny at all.
It is their last movie.
It isn't far from here.
It isn't going to hurt.
It isn't going to snow.
It isn't going to work.
It isn't so cold today.
It just took some time.
It lasted about a year.
It looks good on paper.
It looks like a cactus.
It looks like an apple.
It makes me very happy.
It makes no difference.
It makes perfect sense.
It may not be possible.
It may take many years.
It means nothing to me.
It meant nothing to me.
It might happen to you.
It might not be enough.
It might rain tomorrow.
It needs to be removed.
It rained hard all day.
It rains a lot in June.
It really is a problem.
It really is difficult.
It really is that easy.
It seems to be working.
It should've been mine.
It smelled really good.
It sounds like a dream.
It tastes like chicken.
It was a bad situation.
It was a beautiful day.
It was a chaotic scene.
It was a hard decision.
It was a little sudden.
It was a little tricky.
It was a long time ago.
It was a silly mistake.
It was a simple matter.
It was a strange story.
It was a stressful day.
It was a very big room.
It was a waste of time.
It was a wise decision.
It was all Tom's fault.
It was almost worth it.
It was an amazing game.
It was as hard as rock.
It was beginner's luck.
It was cold last night.
It was in the basement.
It was just an example.
It was kind of strange.
It was kind of surreal.
It was partly my fault.
It was really horrible.
It was sunny yesterday.
It was three hours ago.
It was truly a miracle.
It was very mysterious.
It was very unpleasant.
It was windy yesterday.
It wasn't a total loss.
It wasn't all that bad.
It wasn't an easy sell.
It wasn't premeditated.
It wasn't so difficult.
It will be spring soon.
It won't stop bleeding.
It worked like a charm.
It would be a pleasure.
It'll be a fun weekend.
It'll be a tough match.
It'll certainly be fun.
It's October the third.
It's a beautiful story.
It's a beautiful sword.
It's a big achievement.
It's a book on animals.
It's a complex problem.
It's a fantastic story.
It's a lifesize statue.
It's a matter of taste.
It's a really old book.
It's a religious event.
It's a very small town.
It's across the street.
It's against the rules.
It's ahead of schedule.
It's all right for now.
It's almost like magic.
It's an excellent wine.
It's as simple as that.
It's awfully hot today.
It's been a long night.
It's been a tough week.
It's entirely my fault.
It's freezing out here.
It's going to be great.
It's good for business.
It's hard to sing well.
It's hard to stay calm.
It's highly improbable.
It's impolite to point.
It's impossible for me.
It's impossible to fix.
It's incredibly boring.
It's just a suggestion.
It's just an empty box.
It's just an exception.
It's just as I thought.
It's just like you say.
It's just the opposite.
It's like one of those.
It's making me nervous.
It's never fun to lose.
It's no problem at all.
It's no use doing that.
It's nobody's business.
It's not a money issue.
It's not a new problem.
It's not an easy sport.
It's not far from here.
It's not far to Boston.
It's not getting worse.
It's not going to snow.
It's not going to work.
It's not my cup of tea.
It's not so cold today.
It's not us who did it.
It's not what it seems.
It's now time to relax.
It's obvious, isn't it?
It's out of your hands.
It's partly your fault.
It's pretty cold today.
It's pretty warm today.
It's really cold today.
It's similar to a duck.
It's snowing in Boston.
It's still functioning.
It's strange, isn't it?
It's ten o'clock sharp.
It's the best I can do.
It's their anniversary.
It's time to come home.
It's time to eat lunch.
It's time to get going.
It's time to go to bed.
It's time we went home.
It's too easy that way.
It's too noisy in here.
It's too quiet in here.
It's very cold in here.
It's very dark in here.
It's very embarrassing.
It's very tough to win.
It's what I want to do.
It's worse than before.
It's worth considering.
It's you I've come for.
It's your turn to read.
It's your turn to sing.
Just don't forget this.
Just follow your heart.
Karin is a German name.
Keep Tom and me posted.
Keep it secret, please.

Lie on your right side.
Life is so complicated.
Life isn't fair, is it?
Living here isn't easy.
Look at the blackboard.
Look what has happened.
Look, there's a rabbit!
Looks can be deceiving.
Looks can be deceptive.

Nothing's happened yet.
Now give me your hands.
Of course I was joking.
Of course, he is right.
Oh, don't be like that.
Old people walk slowly.
Once bitten, twice shy.
One must do one's best.

Shouting isn't singing.
Show me another camera.
Show me how to do this.
Show me how you did it.
Show me something else.
Show me today's papers.
Show me your documents.
Simplicity is a virtue.
So how did the date go?

Somebody say something.
Somebody swiped my bag.
Somebody's at the door.
Someone has to help me.
Someone stole my money.
Someone stole my stuff.

Something is different.

Sorry for any mistakes.
Sorry to interrupt you.
Speed isn't everything.
Sport knows no borders.

Start at the beginning.
Staying home isn't fun.

That bicycle isn't his.
That black one is mine.
That boy is very smart.
That boy's name is Tom.
That bridge isn't long.
That cost me a fortune.
That could be arranged.
That doesn't help much.
That doesn't seem fair.
That happens every day.
That happens sometimes.
That house is for sale.
That is very expensive!
That isn't true, is it?
That isn't what I said.
That joke is offensive.
That joke wasn't funny.
That just might happen.
That knife isn't yours.
That looks pretty cool.
That means a lot to me.
That one's my favorite.
That rumor soon spread.
That sometimes happens.
That sounds depressing.
That sounds good to me.
That sounds incredible.
That sounds outrageous.
That sounds reasonable.
That umbrella is Tom's.
That was a big mistake.
That was a close shave.
That was a dirty trick.
That was a great movie.
That was a great party.
That was not necessary.
That was the last time.
That was two years ago.
That wasn't my mistake.
That will be a problem.
That won't be possible.
That won't ever happen.
That would be my guess.
That would be terrible.
That would be the best.
That would be very sad.
That would not be easy.
That would not be wise.
That'll help you a lot.
That's Tom's apartment.
That's a contradiction.
That's a good question.
That's a hard question.
That's a horrible idea.
That's a little unfair.
That's a waste of time.
That's all I have left.
That's also irrelevant.
That's asking too much.
That's hard to picture.
That's highly unlikely.
That's how Tom does it.
That's my CD, isn't it?
That's not Tom's fault.
That's not a good idea.
That's not good enough.
That's not my decision.
That's not true at all.
That's not true either.
That's not what I mean.
That's not what I said.
That's not what I want.
That's part of our job.
That's real convenient.
That's really annoying.
That's so embarrassing.
That's the least of it.
That's the one we want.
That's the spirit, Tom.
That's very easy to do.
That's very impressive.
That's weird, isn't it?
That's what I promised.
That's what I was told.
That's what I would do.
That's what I'm saying.
That's what Tom thinks.
That's what people say.
That's what women want.
That's what's going on.
That's what's so scary.
That's why I came here.
That's why I came late.
That's why I trust you.
That's why Tom is here.
That's why they did it.

These are for you, Tom.
These are hard to make.
These are ostrich eggs.
These glasses are cool.
These horses are Tom's.
These lemons are fresh.

I'm at a loss for words.
I'm aware of the danger.
I'm becoming a real man.
I'm busy, so I can't go.

I'm disappointed in you.
I'm done making excuses.
I'm done with my chores.
I'm dripping with sweat.
I'm faithful to my wife.
I'm fed up with English.
I'm feeling much better.

I'm not as brave as Tom.
I'm not as lucky as you.
I'm not asking for much.
I'm not at all busy now.
I'm not being sarcastic.
I'm not buying anything.
I'm not coming with you.

I'm not worried anymore.
I'm nothing without you.
I'm now learning French.
I'm on my way there now.
I'm on my way to Boston.

I'm open to suggestions.
I'm pleased to meet you.
I'm pretty good at math.

I'm sorry I was so rude.
I'm sorry I'm so stupid.
I'm sorry for your loss.
I'm sorry this happened.
I'm still a little busy.

I'm still not satisfied.
I'm studying French now.
I'm sure Tom means well.
I'm sure Tom misses you.
I'm sure you meant well.
I'm sure you'll succeed.
I'm sure you've met Tom.
I'm taking them with me.
I'm taking tomorrow off.
I'm the one who hit Tom.
I'm tired of backgammon.
I'm tired of pretending.
I'm tired of this place.
I'm too sleepy to drive.
I'm traveling by myself.
I'm trying to apologize.
I'm trying to ignore it.
I'm trying to stay calm.
I'm usually quite frank.
I'm very bad with money.
I'm waiting for a train.
I'm waiting for the bus.
I'm watching television.
I'm willing to help him.
I'm willing to help you.
I've agreed to help Tom.
I've already warned you.
I've been away too long.
I've been busy all week.
I've been enjoying life.
I've been reading a lot.
I've been robbed before.
I've been there already.
I've decided to do that.
I've done no such thing.
I've done nothing wrong.
I've explained all that.
I've forgotten her name.
I've forgotten his name.
I've found a better way.
I've found an apartment.
I've got a crush on you.
I've got an appointment.
I've got claustrophobia.
I've got to do this now.

I've made many mistakes.
I've never hallucinated.
I've never heard of you.
I've never seen Tom cry.
I've never seen a whale.
I've quit drinking beer.
I've seen Tom in action.
I've stopped doing that.
I've told you all I can.
I've trained for months.
If I don't go, who will?
If you want to cry, cry.
If you want, you can go.
If you wish, you can go.
Insomnia is very common.
Invite whoever you like.
Is Boston very far away?
Is French hard to learn?
Is Mary your girlfriend?
Is Tom faster than Mary?
Is Tom going to do that?
Is Tom going to help us?
Is Tom living in Boston?
Is Tom paying attention?
Is Tom smarter than you?
Is Tom taller than Mary?
Is eating raw eggs safe?
Is everything all right?
Is he a friend of yours?
Is he married or single?
Is it a good investment?
Is it all under control?
Is it easy to get there?
Is it raining right now?
Is it worse than before?
Is that a picture of me?
Is that black bag yours?
Is that briefcase Tom's?
Is that what Tom wanted?
Is that what you'd like?
Is that why you stopped?
Is that why you're here?
Is there a pattern here?
Is there a problem, Tom?
Is there any sugar left?
Is there anything wrong?
Is there no alternative?
Is this camera for sale?
Is this really your car?
Is this what you wanted?
Is this where Tom works?
Is this your red pencil?
Is this your toothbrush?
Is your family doing OK?
Is your father a doctor?
Is your father here yet?
Is your husband at home?
Isn't it enough for you?
Isn't it time for lunch?
Isn't one of you enough?
Isn't that a boy's name?
Isn't the weather great?
It all seems so strange.
It appears to be broken.
It can be done in a day.
It can happen to anyone.
It could be coincidence.
It didn't matter to Tom.
It doesn't look so good.
It doesn't matter to me.
It happened by accident.
It happened so long ago.
It happens all the time.
It has Tom's name on it.
It has already happened.
It is not for beginners.
It is our turn to laugh.
It is pretty cold today.
It is pretty warm today.
It is their only choice.
It isn't authentic, Tom.
It isn't the same thing.
It isn't worth the risk.
It just feels different.
It just stopped raining.
It looks like an orange.
It looks very expensive.
It made me a little sad.
It makes my mouth water.
It may freeze next week.
It may rain around noon.
It must be hard for you.
It rained all last week.
It really is your fault.
It really was a miracle.
It seems like yesterday.
It seems that he's fine.
It should be no problem.
It should be ready soon.
It sounds crazy, I know.
It was Tom's, wasn't it?
It was a difficult game.
It was a fine sunny day.
It was a great surprise.
It was a horrible scene.
It was a huge explosion.
It was a small incident.
It was a stupid mistake.
It was all very strange.
It was already too late.
It was always like that.
It was cloudy yesterday.
It was extremely simple.
It was for Tom and Mary.
It was just a bad dream.
It was just a formality.
It was next to the door.
It was only a bad dream.
It was only a nightmare.
It was raining that day.
It was snowing that day.
It was starting to rain.
It was totally worth it.
It was very frustrating.
It was very interesting.
It wasn't Tom's mistake.
It wasn't a coincidence.
It wasn't really a plan.
It wasn't what I wanted.
It won't change a thing.
It'll be ready tomorrow.
It'll work like a charm.
It's Tom I want to meet.
It's a bad time to sell.
It's a beautiful flower.
It's a big country, Tom.
It's a cheap restaurant.
It's a family tradition.
It's a fascinating read.
It's a figure of speech.
It's a legitimate worry.
It's a pain in the neck.
It's a promise Tom kept.
It's a quarter till two.
It's a quarter to three.
It's a reasonable price.
It's a very steep slope.
It's all going to be OK.
It's all in Tom's hands.
It's all right with him.
It's all your own fault.
It's almost six o'clock.
It's already night here.
It's always worth a try.
It's an honest question.
It's back to square one.
It's because I love you.
It's been raining a lot.
It's fun to play tennis.
It's getting cold again.
It's going to get rough.
It's going to get worse.
It's late. I have to go.
It's not anyone's fault.
It's not authentic, Tom.
It's not dinnertime yet.
It's not quite the same.
It's not similar at all.
It's not the same thing.
It's only a slight cold.
It's only three o'clock.
It's past Tom's bedtime.
It's pathetic, isn't it?
It's possible, isn't it?
It's probably a warning.
It's raining everywhere.
It's really pretty here.
It's safer to stay here.
It's so important to me.
It's so nice to be back.
It's standard procedure.
It's still being tested.
It's terribly expensive.
It's the only one I had.
It's time for Tom to go.
It's time to come clean.
It's too early to leave.
It's very hot, isn't it?
It's warm and cozy here.
It's your decision, Tom.
It's your turn to drive.
It's your turn to speak.
Japan is a rich country.
Japan is close to China.

Keep an eye on the bags.
Keep an eye on the door.

Let's do this carefully.
Let's drop by his house.
Let's eat lunch outside.
Let's end this nonsense.
Let's finish this later.
Let's follow his advice.
Let's follow the others.
Let's get out of Boston.
Let's give Tom a chance.
Let's go back to Boston.
Let's go out for a walk.
Let's go to Tom's place.
Let's not do that today.
Let's not do this again.
Let's order two bottles.
Let's play by ourselves.
Let's rent a bike there.
Let's see if that works.
Let's see what happened.
Let's stop wasting time.
Let's try one more time.
Let's wait for our turn.
Let's wait on the porch.
Life has been very hard.
Life is full of secrets.

We've got to do this now.
We've missed you so much.

Let's go, he said to me.
A button came off my coat.

All we can do now is wait.
All we have to do is wait.
All you had to do was ask.
All you have to do is ask.
All's well that ends well.
Am I forgetting something?
Am I responsible for this?
Am I speaking too quickly?
An hour has sixty minutes.
And then, what did you do?
And what do you think now?

Ask Tom to come to Boston.
Ask her what she has done.
At last, the rain stopped.
At least give me a chance.
At least, no one was hurt.
At this point, he arrived.
At what hour was she born?
Australia is no different.
Australia is no exception.
Be careful on those rocks.
Be careful where you step.
Be careful with that, Tom.
Be kind to little animals.
Be very careful with this.

I'm not worried about you.
I'm not writing about you.
I'm one of the lucky ones.
I'm one of your neighbors.
I'm only following orders.
I'm only thirty years old.
I'm pretty sure it's true.
I'm proud of this country.
I'm reading the newspaper.
I'm really hard on myself.
I'm relieving you of duty.
I'm running a little late.
I'm sick of Tom's excuses.
I'm simply planning ahead.
I'm so excited to be here.
I'm so happy for you both.
I'm so happy for you guys.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
I'm sorry if I scared you.
I'm sorry, I have no idea.
I'm starting to get bored.
I'm starting to lose hope.
I'm staying at that hotel.
I'm staying at the Hilton.
I'm still a little hungry.
I'm still able to do that.
I'm still getting dressed.
I'm still studying French.
I'm still taller than Tom.
I'm still working on that.
I'm sure I'll regret this.
I'm sure Tom is mad at me.
I'm sure Tom is with Mary.
I'm sure Tom will be fair.
I'm sure Tom will help us.
I'm sure we can do better.
I'm sure you're very busy.
I'm taking this seriously.
I'm terrible at languages.
I'm testing my new camera.
I'm the one that did that.
I'm throwing in the towel.
I'm too tired to do study.
I'm trying to impress Tom.
I'm trying to lose weight.
I'm trying to protect you.
I'm up to my ears in debt.
I'm used to being ignored.
I'm very happy to be back.
I'm very happy to be here.
I'm very sad to hear that.
I'm waiting for Tom to go.
I'm waiting for my friend.
I'm waiting for my mother.
I'm waiting for the ferry.
I'm waiting for the train.
I'm working in Boston now.
I'm working on a new book.
I'm writing another story.
I've also lived in Boston.
I've always been creative.
I've always been stubborn.
I've always been this way.
I've always hated biology.
I've asked Tom to do that.
I've been here since 2013.
I've been praying for you.
I've been waiting for you.
I've decided to marry Tom.
I've done this many times.
I've done what you wanted.
I've enjoyed your company.
I've explained everything.
I've finished all my work.
I've given up eating meat.
I've got an ear infection.
I've got no time for that.
I've got responsibilities.
I've got something to say.
I've got very little time.
I've had my ups and downs.
I've just come from there.
I've learned how to relax.
I've learned many lessons.
I've lived here for years.
I've lost a little weight.
I've made lots of friends.
I've met that girl before.
I've moved back to Boston.
I've never been a gambler.
I've never been so scared.
I've never been to Boston.
I've never been to Europe.
I've never bought jewelry.
I've never criticized Tom.
I've never driven a truck.
I've never eaten raw fish.
I've never enjoyed flying.
I've never fallen in love.
I've never felt like that.
I've never met a Canadian.
I've never seen a giraffe.
I've never seen a rainbow.
I've never seen you laugh.
I've never slept in class.
I've never studied French.
I've read all your novels.
I've shut all six windows.
I've spent time in Boston.
I've stayed away too long.
I've suddenly lost weight.
I've told you what I know.
I've tried to contact Tom.
I've tried to talk to Tom.
I've visited Boston twice.
If I were you, I'd buy it.
If only I could sing well.
If the shoe fits, wear it.
If you don't eat, you die.
If you go, they'll go too.
If you want to talk, talk.
In 1943, Japan was at war.
In case of fire, dial 119.
Is Tom a Canadian citizen?
Is Tom afraid to be alone?
Is Tom still working here?
Is Tom's name on the list?
Is death the only way out?
Is everything in position?
Is it OK if we smoke here?
Is it going to rain today?
Is it something important?
Is it still far from here?
Is it true Tom can't swim?
Is it your birthday today?
Is money important to you?
Is she your only daughter?
Is the bank far from here?
Is there a bank near here?
Is there a mall near here?
Is there a telephone here?
Is there any life on Mars?
Is there anybody in there?
Is this a pen or a pencil?
Is this water OK to drink?
Is this what you expected?
Is your family doing well?
Is your neighborhood safe?
Isn't it always like that?
Isn't it better like this?
Isn't that enough for you?
Isn't that what they want?
Isn't this Tom's umbrella?
It can be used as a knife.
It can't be a coincidence.
It costs an arm and a leg.
It depends on the context.
It doesn't make any sense.
It doesn't matter anymore.
It doesn't matter so much.
It doesn't seem so absurd.
It doesn't seem very fair.
It doesn't work like that.
It doesn't work very well.
It happens only in Boston.
It hardly ever rains here.
It hurt, but I didn't cry.
It hurts just to stand up.
It is a difficult problem.
It is easy to add 5 to 10.
It is easy to play tennis.
It is nice and warm today.
It is no use trying again.
It is out of the question.
It is still light outside.
It is too early to get up.
It is too good to be true.
It is what everybody says.
It is you who is to blame.
It isn't going to be easy.
It isn't too spicy, is it?
It must've cost a fortune.
It probably won't be easy.
It rained the entire trip.
It rained the whole night.
It really breaks my heart.
It really is unbelievable.
It seems that Tom is busy.
It seems that she's happy.
It seems very interesting.
It seems we're in trouble.
It shouldn't be a problem.
It snowed a lot last year.
It tastes a little bitter.
It was Tom who left early.
It was a beautiful speech.
It was a big deal for Tom.
It was a good opportunity.
It was a great blow to us.
It was a perfect location.
It was a revelation to me.
It was a stroke of genius.
It was a terrible mistake.
It was a terrible tragedy.
It was a very cold winter.
It was crowded in the car.
It was eighty meters long.
It was here that Tom died.
It was just an experiment.
It was kind of a surprise.
It was raining last night.
It was really interesting.
It was sunny this morning.
It was the only way to go.
It was your grandfather's.
It wasn't us who did that.
It will be very expensive.
It will stop raining soon.
It won't take much longer.
It'll be better next time.
It's Tom's birthday today.
It's a beautiful painting.
It's a difficult language.
It's a difficult question.
It's a little complicated.
It's a small price to pay.
It's a very serious crime.
It's a very urgent matter.
It's already dark outside.
It's already nine o'clock.
It's an honor to meet you.
It's bad luck to say that.
It's been a difficult day.
It's been a stressful day.
It's difficult being rich.
It's difficult to do that.
It's difficult to explain.
It's easier than it looks.
It's extremely cold today.
It's for a friend of mine.
It's fun to play baseball.
It's getting dark outside.
It's getting on my nerves.
It's good to see Tom back.
It's hard not to like Tom.
It's hard to say for sure.
It's hard to stop smoking.
It's hard to surprise Tom.
It's harder than it looks.
It's just how things work.
It's just started raining.
It's just started snowing.
It's like an oven in here.
It's likely to rain today.
It's much easier this way.
It's my younger brother's.
It's nearly three o'clock.
It's none of our business.
It's none of your concern.
It's not always like this.
It's not exactly a secret.
It's not exactly a strike.
It's not going to be easy.
It's not going to be long.
It's not really necessary.
It's not such a long list.
It's not that complicated.
It's not too spicy, is it?
It's not very complicated.
It's not very windy today.
It's not worth it anymore.
It's obvious that he lied.
It's only a minor setback.
It's probably a good idea.
It's quarter to eight now.
It's quiet in the suburbs.
It's quite cold, isn't it?
It's raining hard tonight.
It's really not that hard.
It's simple, but it works.
It's snowing where Tom is.
It's starting to cool off.
It's starting to get cold.
It's starting to get dark.
It's such a beautiful day.
It's the third of October.
It's time to feed the dog.
It's time to go to school.
It's time you went to bed.
It's totally dark outside.
It's very humid, isn't it?
It's very warm in my room.
It's very, very important.
It's warm today, isn't it?
It's way too cold to swim.
It's wonderful to be here.
It's your fault, not mine.
Jackson is my family name.
Jazz is not my speciality.
Jeans take forever to dry.
Just don't give up on Tom.
Just give me the car keys.
Just ignore what Tom said.
Just pretend I'm not here.
Keep an eye on Tom for me.
Learning French is useful.
Leave the poor girl alone.
Let Tom eat what he wants.
Let me ask you a question.
Let me be honest with you.
Let me help you with that.
Let me pay for the dinner.
Let me stay here with you.
Let the celebration start.
Let's assume Tom is right.
Let's begin with Lesson 3.
Let's buy the cheaper one.
Let's check one more time.
Let's eat out next Monday.
Let's end it here and now.
Let's fight them together.
Let's get a little closer.
Let's get out of the taxi.
Let's have lunch together.
Let's hope he's all right.
Let's hope it still works.
Let's jump into the water.
Let's listen to some jazz.
Let's meet this afternoon.
Let's not forget the beer.
Let's not get discouraged.
Let's not go into details.
Let's not let that happen.
Let's play football today.
Let's return to the hotel.
Let's see what you've got.
Let's stop here for today.
Let's take a picture here.
Let's take the 4:10 train.
Life is full of surprises.
Little remains to be done.
Make room for the baggage.
Many attended his funeral.
Many people are skeptical.
Many thanks for your help.

Should I help Tom do that?
Should I open the windows?
Should I see a specialist?
Should I wash the lettuce?
Should we have some lunch?
Shouldn't you be studying?
Shouldn't you talk to Tom?
Silence isn't always good.
Slip this into your purse.
Smoking is forbidden here.
So Tom, what do you think?
So what's the big mystery?
So, are you seeing anyone?

Stop making matters worse.
Suddenly Tom began to cry.
Suddenly, it became noisy.
Swallow it. Don't chew it.
Take a breath and hold it.
Take any train on track 5.
Take it easy and get well.
Take my name off the list.
Tell Tom I won't be there.
Tell Tom I'm proud of him.
Tell Tom he has to get up.
Tell Tom that I'm thirsty.

That book costs 3,000 yen.
That disease is incurable.
That doesn't happen a lot.
That happened decades ago.
That happened to me twice.
That happens all the time.
That has really helped us.
That helps me fall asleep.
That house belongs to him.
That is rather unexpected.
That made me very nervous.
That may not be necessary.
That might be appropriate.
That might have been true.
That plan is unacceptable.
That plan's bound to fail.
That seems familiar to me.
That seems understandable.
That should be prohibited.
That sounds strange to me.
That sounds very tempting.
That tie really suits you.
That was a big difference.
That was a waste of money.
That was an inconvenience.
That was money well spent.
That was quite impressive.
That was totally my fault.
That was very scary to me.
That wasn't very romantic.
That woman's name is Mary.
That won't change a thing.

That would be interesting.
That'll cost thirty euros.

That's a bunch of hogwash.
That's a really big apple.
That's a really nice name.
That's all I have for you.
That's all I have to know.
That's all I need to hear.
That's all you have to do.
That's bad for your heart.
That's certainly possible.
That's from Tom, isn't it?
That's it. I'm outta here.
That's just how I like it.
That's just the beginning.
That's not what Tom wants.
That's our French teacher.
That's probably a mistake.
That's really distressing.
That's the absolute truth.
That's the right attitude.
That's very controversial.
That's what I said to Tom.
That's what I want to ask.
That's what I want to say!
That's what everyone does.
That's what we have to do.
That's what we usually do.
That's what's worrying me.

I suppose it's a bit silly.

I was born and raised here.
I was born in the thirties.
I was born on June 4, 1974.
I was completely exhausted.
I was expecting a lot more.

I'm not talking about that.
I'm not trying to be funny.
I'm not who you think I am.

I've been here a month now.
I've been known to do that.
I've been paying attention.
I've been very busy lately.
I've been wandering around.
I've bought a gift for Tom.
I've brought you something.
I've changed my mind again.
I've decided to take a nap.
I've done that all my life.
I've done this all my life.
I've downloaded some stuff.
I've forgotten my password.
I've forgotten your number.
I've found a place to live.
I've got a meeting at 2:30.
I've got everything I want.
I've got friends in Boston.
I've got good news for you.
I've got lots of questions.
I've got nothing to report.
I've got plenty of friends.
I've got to go to the bank.
I've got to hand it to Tom.
I've had enough, thank you.
I've heard a lot about you.
I've helped a lot, I think.
I've just hired a new maid.
I've known Tom a long time.
I've learned from the best.
I've learned to trust them.

If you get sleepy, tell me.
If you need help, just ask.
If you try, you'll succeed.
If you're happy, I'm happy.
If you're hungry, then eat.
In fact, he even loved her.
In other words, he is lazy.
In the end, we got married.
Is Tom old enough to drink?
Is Tom still eating dinner?
Is eating raw pumpkin safe?
Is eating whale meat wrong?
Is everything alright here?
Is it always hot like this?
Is it difficult to do that?
Is it getting cold outside?
Is it hard to learn French?
Is it hard to speak French?
Is it true Tom can't drive?
Is it true you got married?
Is now a good time to talk?
Is one thousand yen enough?
Is someone waiting for you?
Is ten thousand yen enough?
Is that a cow or a buffalo?
Is that all you have to do?
Is that dog male or female?
Is that what you want, Tom?
Is the game still going on?

Isn't Tom having breakfast?
Isn't that skirt too short?
Isn't that what you wanted?
Isn't that why you're here?
Isn't that worth some risk?
It almost never rains here.
It always happens this way.
It cost 30 million dollars.
It could be worth millions.
It couldn't have been easy.
It didn't seem appropriate.
It doesn't make much sense.
It happened just like this.
It happened quite recently.
It hasn't always been easy.
It hasn't been painted yet.
It is fun to play baseball.
It is getting dark outside.
It is just half past seven.
It is likely to rain today.
It is raining all the time.
It is said that he is sick.
It is still a little scary.
It is time to go to school.
It isn't worth waiting for.
It isn't written in French.
It isn't your money I want.
It just wasn't meant to be.
It kept raining for a week.
It looks like Tom is tired.
It looks like Tom is tough.
It looks like you're wrong.
It makes little difference.
It may rain this afternoon.
It must be nice to be rich.
It seems interesting to me.
It seems that Tom is lying.
It shouldn't have happened.
It started raining heavily.
It still happens sometimes.
It was a beautiful wedding.
It was a complete disaster.
It was a fascinating story.
It was a great loss for me.
It was a great shock to me.
It was filmed in Australia.
It was fun while it lasted.
It was good talking to you.
It was just my imagination.
It was love at first sight.
It was my decision to make.
It was my fault, not Tom's.
It was nice and cool there.
It was nice talking to you.
It was not always this way.
It was obviously a mistake.
It was pitch black outside.
It was really embarrassing.
It was the best party ever.
It was the general opinion.
It was very cold in Boston.
It wasn't always like this.
It wasn't an easy decision.
It wasn't much of a debate.
It wasn't that bad, was it?
It will be cloudy tomorrow.
It will only hurt a little.
It's 4:30 in the afternoon.
It's Tom I want to talk to.
It's Tom who's the problem.
It's a bit crowded in here.
It's a fact you can't deny.
It's a first-rate hospital.
It's a good plan, isn't it?
It's a pity you can't come.
It's a quote from the book.
It's a very large property.
It's a very simple process.
It's absolutely impossible.
It's all Tom seems to have.
It's all you can really do.
It's an easy plant to grow.
It's an excellent solution.
It's been nice meeting you.
It's been raining all week.
It's been raining for days.
It's better than the movie.
It's complicated, isn't it?
It's complicated, you know.
It's definitely a nuisance.
It's easier said than done.
It's easier than I thought.
It's easier than you think.
It's easy to work in jeans.
It's enough for three days.
It's every man for himself.
It's going to be difficult.
It's going to be expensive.
It's good to have you back.
It's good to see you again.
It's good to see you smile.
It's harder than you think.
It's his problem, not mine.
It's impossible to explain.
It's interesting, isn't it?
It's just a piece of paper.
It's just your imagination.
It's kind of hot, isn't it?
It's late already. Go home.
It's more than you deserve.
It's never happened before.
It's nice and warm in here.
It's none of your business.
It's not cheap to eat here.
It's not going to be cheap.
It's not going to end well.
It's not going to work out.
It's not worth waiting for.
It's not written in French.
It's not your money I want.
It's only a matter of time.
It's raining cats and dogs.
It's riskier than it looks.
It's the next logical step.
It's too late to apologize.
It's very cold in my house.
It's very hard living here.
It's you I'm worried about.

Let's try another approach.
Let's walk a little faster.
Let's watch a horror movie.
Life has its ups and downs.
Lightning can be dangerous.

Look at those black clouds.
Look at what Tom's wearing.

We had to do that ourselves.
We have French third period.
We have a lot of work to do.
We have a problem with that.
We have about 300 employees.
We have all we need for now.
We have better things to do.
We have great teachers here.
We have less than two hours.
We have no more information.
We have nothing else to eat.
We have only a small garden.
We have some wonderful news.
We have three possibilities.
We have to abandon the plan.
We have to do without sugar.
We have to expect the worst.
We have to keep this secret.
We have to start over again.
We have to wash the clothes.
We haven't been invited yet.
We haven't decided anything.
We haven't finished talking.
We haven't had any problems.
We haven't reached our goal.
We haven't seen this before.
We haven't won anything yet.
We hid in the cave together.
We hope that you'll succeed.
We hope to lower the tariff.
We hope you enjoy the movie.
We invited him to our house.
We just need money to do it.
We just need thirty minutes.
We just need to be creative.
We just need to talk to Tom.
We just want to talk to you.
We kept our fingers crossed.
We know you're Tom's friend.
We learn by trial and error.
We leave tomorrow afternoon.
We live in a beautiful city.
We met him on the way there.
We must be alert to dangers.
We need a little time alone.
We need guns and ammunition.
We need to have a talk, Tom.
We need to hire more people.
We need to talk to everyone.
We never saw Tom after that.
We only have one television.
We only have three bicycles.
We play chess every evening.
We play tennis after school.
We played football together.
We read about that in class.
We really enjoyed ourselves.
We rented a cabin by a lake.
We rented a romantic comedy.
We rested there for an hour.
We saw a castle ahead of us.
We should be talking to Tom.
We should have left earlier.
We should not lose patience.
We should've stayed at home.
We slept on a very long bed.
We stayed up until midnight.
We studied French in school.
We talked about many things.
We talked about this before.
We talked to them yesterday.
We think you should come in.
We thought it was hilarious.
We treat our customers well.
We underestimated the enemy.
We understand you perfectly.
We used to be close friends.
We used to have Mondays off.
We usually talked in French.
We visited Boston last week.
We want further information.
We want to help Tom do that.
We want to remain like this.
We went along with his plan.
We went to Boston last week.
We went to Boston last year.
We went to London last year.
We went to the park to play.
We were all on the same bus.
We were all rooting for Tom.
We were all rooting for you.
We were forced to work hard.
We were in Boston last week.
We were made for each other.
We were only trying to help.
We were playing in the park.
We were the first to arrive.
We were told not to do that.
We were very busy last week.
We weren't paying attention.
We will be together forever.
We will do anything for you.
We will go, but without you.
We won't be here after 2:30.
We would like to buy a sofa.
We'd better not remain here.
We'll be happy to cooperate.
We'll do what we have to do.
We'll get in touch with you.
We'll give you your revenge.
We'll have to do this later.
We'll see who answers first.
We'll take care of the rest.
We're a peace-loving nation.
We're about the same height.
We're counting on your help.
We're glad to have Tom here.
We're going to be just fine.
We're going to make changes.
We're going to name him Tom.
We're no different than Tom.
We're not going to harm you.
We're not scared of anybody.
We're not teenagers anymore.
We're on the same side, Tom.
We're one big, happy family.
We're only here to help Tom.
We're proud to be Canadians.
We're reading the same book.
We're still discussing that.
We're still working on that.
We're surprised at the news.
We're wasting precious time.
We've already done our work.
We've arrived a little late.
We've done that in the past.
We've got less than an hour.
We've got nothing in common.
We've got some news for you.
We've got to find Tom first.
We've made a stupid mistake.

I'm tired of all this nagging.
I'm tired of listening to Tom.
I'm trying to clean the house.
I'm trying to get out of here.
I'm trying to save Tom's life.
I'm turning thirty in October.
I'm unfamiliar with that term.
I'm unfamiliar with that word.
I'm very concerned about this.
I'm very proud of my daughter.
I'm very reluctant to do that.
I'm waiting for my girlfriend.
I'm wearing Tom's old pajamas.
I'm wearing an orange T-shirt.
I'm willing to take that risk.
I'm worried about the weather.
I'm young, but I'm not afraid.
I've already bought my ticket.
I've already done my homework.
I've already finished my work.
I've already taken care of it.
I've always been proud of Tom.
I've been a little distracted.
I've been anxious to meet you.
I've been concerned about you.
I've been here for three days.
I've been stabbed three times.
I've been working all my life.
I've done enough harm already.
I've done questionable things.
I've done that numerous times.
I've done what I needed to do.
I've enjoyed talking with you.

I've got no time for that now.
I've got only myself to blame.
I've got to get some shut eye.
I've got to get to sleep soon.
I've got to go back and check.
I've heard that story already.
I've learned a lot since then.
I've learned from my mistakes.
I've lived here my whole life.
I've locked my keys in my car.
I've lost the key to my house.
I've married the wrong person.
I've never been abroad before.

I've only been to Boston once.
I've read many kinds of books.
I've recently moved to Boston.
I've seen this picture before.
I've still got a lot to learn.
I've studied French, remember?
I've thought about that a lot.
I've written a lot of stories.
If I were you, I'd stay quiet.
If Tom does that, let me know.
If Tom wants to leave, he can.
If only I could speak English!
Ignorance always creates fear.
In fact, I was born in Boston.
In my opinion, she is correct.
In this respect, you're right.
Is French harder than English?
Is Tom any good at basketball?
Is Tom aware of what Mary did?
Is Tom going to do that today?
Is Tom going to press charges?
Is Tom still living in Boston?
Is eating healthy more costly?
Is everyone here with the CIA?
Is freedom a place or an idea?
Is gold cheaper than platinum?
Is it Christmas again already?
Is it far from here to Boston?
Is it hard to be a vegetarian?
Is it hard to learn Esperanto?
Is it here that the bus stops?
Is it safe to eat cockroaches?

I'm trying to meet the deadline.
I'm trying to solve the problem.
I'm used to talking to children.
I'm very grateful for your help.
I'm very sorry your father died.

I've accepted Tom's resignation.
I've already decided what to do.
I've already explained all that.
I've already returned the books.
I've already spent my allowance.
I've already told you the truth.
I've always liked horror movies.
I've always respected my father.
I've always wondered about this.
I've been a teacher a long time.
I've been busy repairing things.
I've been calling you all night.
I've been dreaming a lot lately.
I've been given a second chance.
I've been having strange dreams.
I've been saying the same thing.

I've been to Boston on business.
I've been to Boston three times.
I've been waiting for two hours.

I've given Tom too many chances.
I've given you too many chances.
I've got a million things to do.

I've understood hardly anything.
I've visited Boston a few times.
I've waited as long as possible.
I've worked three hours already.
If I had time, I could help you.
If I were you, I wouldn't do it.
If I were you, I wouldn't do so.
If I were you, I'd buy that one.
If I were you, I'd study harder.
If I weren't sick, I'd join you.
If Tom is going, I'm going, too.
If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
If that happens, give me a call.
If the wind dies down, we'll go.
If you make a mess, clean it up.
If you need anything, just call.
In February, I was in Sao Paulo.
In doing anything, do your best.

Write about the following topic.
Yesterday, he told me the truth.
You all know I'm not a criminal.
You and I should stick together.
You and I should study together.
You appear unwilling to do that.
You are always doubting my word.
You are not to blame, nor is he.
You are too young to be in love.
You are very attractive in blue.
You aren't allowed in this room.
You aren't doing that correctly.
You can be arrested at any time.
You can change that if you want.
You can do whatever you want to.
You can speak French, can't you?
You can't always avoid problems.
You can't break the appointment.
You can't force me to marry you.
You can't just change your mind.
You can't make someone like you.
You can't speak French, can you?
You can't survive without money.
You delivered the wrong package.
You deserve to be congratulated.
You desperately need a vacation.
You didn't need to tell me that.
You don't have to be so nervous.
You don't know a thing about me.
You don't know anything, do you?
You don't know how worried I am.
You don't like Tom much, do you?
You don't look like your father.
You don't need to come so early.
You don't need to speak so loud.
You don't need to worry anymore.
You don't seem to be very tired.
You don't sound very optimistic.
You guys should be more careful.
You had better take an umbrella.
You had it right the first time.
You have already eaten the cake.
You have ice cream on your face.
You have our total support, Tom.
You have to be over 18 to drive.
You have to respect your elders.
You have to study French harder.
You have to tell Tom everything.
You haven't done anything wrong.
You helped us do that last year.
You know I'm older than you are.
You know quite a lot about Sumo.
You know some French, don't you?
You know what I want, don't you?
You know what I'm talking about.
You know where it is, don't you?
You know where the problem lies.
You like older women, don't you?
You look a lot like your father.
You look a lot like your sister.
You look like you're frustrated.
You made the same mistake again.
You may invite anybody you want.
You may make use of his library.
You may want to slow down a bit.
You might find this interesting.
You misinterpreted what I wrote.
You must teach me what you know.
You must write your name in ink.
You mustn't keep a lady waiting.
You need to eat more vegetables.
You need to stop being so pushy.
You need to study French harder.
You need to take this seriously.
You need to tell Tom to do that.
You never let me do what I want.
You only have yourself to blame.
You ought to ask him for advice.
You owe me another thirty bucks.
You really are rude, aren't you?
You really didn't know, did you?
You said you'd help Tom do that.
You seem to know a lot about it.
You shall not marry my daughter!
You should be back by 9 o'clock.
You should come back here again.
You should come home before six.
You should do your homework now.
You should follow Tom's example.
You should get back in your car.
You should have seen that movie.
You should keep your mouth shut.
You should listen to his advice.
You should not stay up too late.
You should stay here a few days.
You should've gotten up earlier.
You should've told me the truth.
You shouldn't eat anything cold.
You shouldn't have voted for me.
You shouldn't have written that.
You shouldn't swim in that pool.
You speak French extremely well.
You still don't do that, do you?
You still have so much to learn.
You stole the money, didn't you?
You sure do use a lot of butter.
You swim a lot better than I do.
You talk quite a lot, don't you?
You told me it was an emergency.
You told me that you were tired.
You two make a beautiful couple.
You used to like me, didn't you?
You want another one, don't you?
You will never know where he is.
You won't be needing that again.
You would never do such a thing.
You wouldn't do that, would you?
You'd better have a good excuse.
You'd better not go there again.
You'd better tell me everything.

I'm afraid you've misunderstood me.
I'm always the first one to arrive.
I'm aware of all those connections.
I'm being good to you this morning.
I'm better at juggling than Tom is.

I'm pretty good at French, I think.
I'm pretty sure Tom won't eat that.
I'm pretty sure that Tom won't win.
I'm pretty uncomfortable right now.
I'm really not very good at French.
I'm responsible for protecting Tom.
I'm right where I'm supposed to be.
I'm sick of eating out every night.
I'm sorry I didn't let you do that.
I'm sorry I made you cry yesterday.
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

I was a coal miner for thirty years.
I was able to swim across the river.
I was angry before, but not anymore.

I'm writing a letter to my daughter.
I've already answered this question.
I've always been very proud of that.
I've always wanted to sing on stage.
I've asked Tom not to do that again.
I've asked you this question before.
I've become very good at doing that.
I've been here for over three hours.
I've been in Boston for three years.
I've been meaning to speak with you.
I've been told this is a quiet town.
I've been waiting for that question.
I've finally learned how to do that.
I've got a lot of friends in Boston.
I've had to do everything by myself.
I've just come up with a great idea.
I've known Tom for almost ten years.
I've made up my mind to work harder.
I've misplaced my French dictionary.

It probably wasn't Tom who did that.
It seems like Tom enjoys doing that.
It seems like you don't remember me.
It seems that no one knew the truth.
It should be interesting to do that.
It sounds impossible, but it's true.
It sounds like you want to be alone.
It takes courage to do such a thing.
It took me several hours to do that.
It was Tom's idea to sell our house.
It was a good and interesting night.
It was about 2:30 when Tom got here.
It was expensive to fix the machine.
It was impossible to find an answer.
It was me that took out the garbage.
It was no bigger than a soccer ball.
It was stupid of me to believe that!
It was too early to call the police.
It was very crowded in the elevator.
It was yesterday that he went there.

It's hard to get by on minimum wage.
It's just what I was thinking about.

It's perfect, if I do say so myself.
It's the fastest train in the world.
It's true that Americans love pizza.
It's up to you to decide what to do.

Let's make the world a better place.
Let's not ever try doing that again.
Let's not let this chance slip away.
Let's not talk about that right now.
Let's pretend that nothing happened?
Let's see what else we can find out.
Let's sit where there is some shade.
Let's start with the easy questions.
Let's think about that for a minute.
Let's think about that for a moment.
Let's try to see it from all angles.

I love walking barefoot on the grass.
I made a serious mistake on the test.
I made myself a cup of hot chocolate.
I made sure that no one was watching.
I mean it when I say that I love you.
I might be able to help you find Tom.
I must confess I haven't read it yet.

I ran across my uncle at the station.
I ran into Mary at a party last week.
I read an interesting book yesterday.

I read the whole book in one evening.
I really enjoyed myself at the party.
I really love her older sister a lot.
I recommend that you read that novel.
I remember having seen her somewhere.
I remember the day when we first met.
I remember the house where I grew up.
I returned to Boston on October 20th.

I run three kilometers every morning.
I sat down on the ground next to Tom.
I saw a black cat run into the house.
I saw some monkeys climbing the tree.
I saw the boxing match on television.
I saw the girl swimming in the river.
I see why you don't want to go there.
I share an apartment with my brother.
I should've shown Tom how to do that.
I shouldn't have done that by myself.

I think what Tom did was intentional.
I think you should give Tom a chance.
I think you shouldn't have done that.
I think you're going to like it here.
I think you're making a mistake, Tom.
I think you've made the wrong choice.
I thought I was going to kill myself.
I thought Tom was going to be killed.
I thought Tom would be asleep by now.
I thought Tom wouldn't want any help.
I thought it was something like that.
I thought that it was pretty obvious.
I thought that that was really weird.
I thought that went exceedingly well.
I thought that you'd be in your room.
